So Go is a pretty cool language created by Google for software engineers. It's
pretty awesome for multiple reasons, one of which is that the language was
created with concurrency in mind. Running programs concurrently is pretty awesome
and straight forward with Go routines and using Go channels. If that sounds scary,
its really not that bad. Look through some of the resources, and I'm sure you'll
begin to feel better.

Congratulations on becoming a Gopher.
