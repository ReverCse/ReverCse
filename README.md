# ReverCse
ReverCse: A repository for developers to share code and resources they've accrued through their experience as a programmer. This not only holds code, but documentation and resources to enable quicker development. The goal is to reduce time researching and finding good resources and enabling developers to utilize resources created or discovered by others to achieve their goals.
